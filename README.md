# How Subjects are Structured

Subjects will have a common structure, so that learning is more efficient. 
The structure is generally like so: 

1. Concepts and Intuition - For example, what is a Derivative and why does it work, intuitively?
2. Applications - For example, a Derivative may be used to find the minimum and maximum values of a given function.
3. Examples - For example, d/dx(x^2) = 2x
4. Exercises - Question 1: What is d/dx(2x^2)? ; Question 1 Answer: d/dx(2x^2) = 4x
5. Cheat Sheets and Reference - List of all derivatives.

# How the Code will be Structured

Since we are following the structure of Subjects, we will have a standard format for the code and notes as well. 
Below is the file structure that will be for a given subject:

## Code Structure Template
